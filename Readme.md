Short Description

Our project, "Decentralized Safety Factor Calculation," leverages the Bacalhau compute network to dynamically assess the economic security of blockchain protocols. By integrating real-time data, the system calculates the Cost of Corruption (CoC), Profit from Corruption (PfC), and Safety Factor (SF) to ensure protocols remain robust against potential threats.

Project Summary

Title: Decentralized Safety Factor Calculation on Bacalhau

Overview:

The Decentralized Safety Factor Calculation project introduces a groundbreaking approach to evaluating the economic security of various blockchain protocols using the decentralized computation platform Bacalhau. This tool aims to calculate three critical metrics: Cost of Corruption (CoC), Profit from Corruption (PfC), and Safety Factor (SF), which collectively offer insights into the vulnerability of blockchain protocols to malicious activities.

Objective:

Our primary goal is to provide blockchain developers and security analysts with a reliable, real-time tool to assess the security landscape of their protocols. By understanding the potential economic incentives for corruption, stakeholders can better safeguard their systems against attacks.

Methodology:

The project utilizes a Docker container deployed on Bacalhau, which processes input parameters related to staking and potential attack profits. The system is designed to:

- Gather Data: Collect real-time staking data and potential attack vectors.
- Calculate Metrics: Compute CoC (sum of all staked tokens at risk and operational costs), PfC (potential gains from successful attacks), and SF (the ratio indicating security robustness).
- Output Results: Display calculated metrics in a clear, concise manner for protocol analysts to make informed decisions.

Technology Stack:

- Bacalhau: Utilized for deploying and running our Dockerized Python application in a decentralized environment, ensuring transparency and reducing reliance on centralized cloud services.
- Docker: Ensures that our application runs consistently across different computing environments.
- Python: Used for scripting the calculations and handling data input and output.

Impact and Innovation:

This project stands out by bringing decentralized computation to the realm of blockchain security, an area traditionally dominated by centralized analytics tools. By leveraging Bacalhau, we not only enhance the reliability of our calculations through distributed computing but also democratize access to security analytics, allowing smaller blockchain projects the same level of insight as top-tier protocols.

Future Directions:

We plan to integrate more sophisticated economic models and support for additional blockchain networks. Long-term goals include real-time monitoring capabilities and automated alert systems for anomalies in economic security metrics.

By submitting this project, we aim to highlight the potential of decentralized computing in enhancing blockchain security and fostering a safer blockchain ecosystem for all participants.
